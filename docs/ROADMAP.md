# Knowledge Mesh — Roadmap

## Done

### Phase 0 — Foundation (MVP)
- ✅ pnpm/TypeScript monorepo: `apps/{indexer,extractor,api,mcp-server}` + `packages/shared`
- ✅ PostgreSQL + pgvector (`knowledge` DB): documents, chunks, entities, relations, sync/extraction state
- ✅ Neo4j graph projection (idempotent, fully rebuildable from Postgres)
- ✅ Obsidian vault as the human source of truth (`CDON_Vault`)
- ✅ Local embeddings (transformers.js, all-MiniLM-L6-v2) — no API keys
- ✅ MVP validated end-to-end: note → Postgres → Neo4j → API, with traceable provenance

### Indexing
- ✅ Incremental indexer (SHA-256 content hashes), full-scan and watch modes
- ✅ Deletion/move handling: vault deletes cascade through Postgres and Neo4j
- ✅ Frontmatter capture, heading-based chunking, wikilink → relation extraction
- ✅ Watcher runs as a launchd service (live indexing on vault edits)

### Retrieval (Phase 1)
- ✅ Hybrid search: vector + Postgres full-text, fused with RRF — exact tokens
  (service names, Kafka topics) always findable
- ✅ Result metadata: entity type, tags, match source
- ✅ `GET /note` + `knowledge_get` — full-note reads through the API/MCP
- ✅ Prescriptive MCP tool descriptions (agents know *when* to use each tool)

### Semantic layer (Phase 2)
- ✅ LLM extractor (`claude -p` headless, on subscription; model/concurrency configurable)
- ✅ Semantic objects: Decision, Idea, Claim, Problem, Constraint, Pattern, Technology, Project
- ✅ Structural objects: Service, Topic, BoundedContext with exhaustive
  PUBLISHES_TO / SUBSCRIBES_TO / CALLS_HTTP / BELONGS_TO extraction
- ✅ Provenance: every object carries `EXTRACTED_FROM` → source note
- ✅ Incremental + idempotent (re-extraction replaces exactly its own output; orphan cleanup)
- ✅ `GET /graph` + `knowledge_graph` — typed neighborhood traversal (1–3 hops)
- ✅ `GET /impact` + `knowledge_impact` — blast-radius reports for platform services,
  including attached Constraints/Decisions/Problems

### Agent access & ops
- ✅ Knowledge API (Fastify) on localhost:3333, launchd-managed, survives reboots
- ✅ MCP server registered user-wide in Claude Code (7 tools)
- ✅ Agent write path: `/remember`, `/proposal` → `vault/agents/<agent>/` only,
  collision-safe, provenance frontmatter
- ✅ Agent status write-back validated end-to-end (commission cleanup status note
  → searchable in seconds → human promoted it into the plan)
- ✅ **Audited edits of human notes** — `knowledge_update_note` /
  `knowledge_undo_edit`: surgical old→new edits with mandatory reason,
  Postgres audit log (`note_edits`), stepwise undo while history remains.
  Replaces the blanket "agents never touch human notes" rule with
  "every edit is attributed and reversible"
- ✅ **Event-driven extraction** — vault changes arm a 3-min quiet-period timer
  in the watcher; extraction runs automatically after editing stops
  (30-min launchd job kept as a fallback; Postgres advisory lock prevents
  overlapping runs; orphan sweep covers note deletions)

### Infrastructure & retrieval quality (post-hackathon)
- ✅ **Knowledge Mesh** settled as the project name
- ✅ Neo4j migrated podman container → native brew service; podman VM retired
  (~4 GB RAM reclaimed); zero-VM boot chain: Postgres + Neo4j (brew),
  API + watcher (launchd)
- ✅ Embeddings upgraded `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384d, 256 ctx) →
  **Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B q8** (1024d, last-token pooling, instruct-aware
  queries, multilingual) — validated against golden queries, no regressions
- ✅ Single resident embedding model: `POST /embed` + `EMBEDDING_REMOTE_URL`,
  indexer/watcher delegate to the API (no per-process model copies)
- ✅ `pnpm migrate` handles embedding-dimension changes automatically
- ✅ Relation ownership fix: indexer replaces only its own relations
  (`origin_document_id IS NULL`), extractor manages its own — force reindex
  no longer wipes structural edges
- ✅ Entity dedup: separator-insensitive name matching + one-off SQL merge
  (85 duplicates collapsed)

## Next

### Near term
- [ ] **Golden-set as a script** — the 8-query before/after comparison was run
  manually for the embedding migration; codify 10–15 canonical questions into
  a repeatable script run after every retrieval change
- [ ] **Orphan semantic cleanup in the indexer path** — deletions fully clean the
  graph immediately, not at next extract run
- [ ] **MOC (Map of Content) notes** — generated index notes per area
  (QLTY platform, Commissions) for human navigation and agent drill-down
- [x] **Vault is the single source** — all references to
  `fyndiq-2.0/platform_analysis` removed from skills/agents; fallbacks point at
  the vault itself (✅ 2026-06-11). The analysis-update mechanism (repo diff →
  vault notes) will be redesigned separately
- [x] **Rewire QLTY skills** — `qlty-pr-service-change-analyzer` computes blast
  radius via `knowledge_impact` (MCP or curl) with vault-on-disk fallback, plus
  Step 7 write-back via `knowledge_remember`; `qlty-platform-guide` rewritten as
  "how to query the Knowledge Mesh"; `qlty-analyst` agent queries the API first, code
  second. Skills now live in this repo (`skills/`) and are symlinked into
  `~/.claude/skills` (✅ 2026-06-11)
- [x] **Scheduled extraction** — launchd job (`com.knowledge-mesh.extract`) runs the
  incremental extractor every 30 min; Postgres advisory lock prevents
  overlapping runs (✅ 2026-06-11)

### Near term (hygiene)
- [x] **Backups** — laptop-friendly: hourly launchd check with a ≥20h freshness
  rule (backs up in the first awake window each day), `pg_dump` + vault
  archive, 14-copy rotation, optional rclone offsite to Google Drive
  (✅ 2026-06-11; one-time `rclone config` pending on the owner)
- [x] **`pnpm run doctor`** — one-screen health report: vault, Postgres counts,
  Neo4j, API + embedding pipeline, claude CLI, launchd services, backup
  freshness (✅ 2026-06-11)
- [x] **CLAUDE.md** — architecture invariants, layout, working conventions for
  agents/colleagues in the repo (✅ 2026-06-11)

### Mid term
- [x] **`origin: agent` provenance on semantic objects** — every graph node
  carries `origin: human | agent` (agent only while *all* source notes are
  agent-written); surfaced in `/graph` nodes and `/impact` attached knowledge
  so agents can weigh agent-sourced knowledge (echo-chamber protection)
  (✅ 2026-06-12)
- [x] **Analysis-update mechanism** — implemented as a private script
  (`scripts/local/`, gitignored — tied to the owner's org setup): hourly
  batches walk service notes, compare the note's recorded analysis commit
  against the repo's GitHub head (no local clones), an LLM judges the diff and
  applies surgical audited vault edits; the commit marker is always bumped.
  All services re-checked roughly daily (✅ 2026-06-11)
- [x] **Plugin for Paperclip** — `integrations/paperclip-plugin/`
  (`knowledge-mesh`): contributes 6 `knowledge_*` agent tools wrapping
  the Knowledge API (search/context/get/impact/remember/changes) plus a
  dashboard health widget, so Paperclip-orchestrated agents share the same
  memory as Claude Code sessions; installed via
  `paperclipai plugin install <path>` (✅ 2026-06-12). Phase 2 — **proactive
  memory**: the plugin subscribes to `issue.created`/`issue.updated`, and when
  an issue carries a GitHub PR URL it parses the repo slug (no GitHub access),
  calls `knowledge_impact`, and posts the blast-radius as a comment before a
  reviewer starts — idempotent per issue, `prImpactComments` flag, verified
  live against a real Paperclip issue (✅ 2026-06-13)
- [ ] **Entity dedup/canonicalization pass** — merge near-duplicate names
  ("Refund service" vs "refund-service"), periodic curation report of new
  semantic entities for human review
- [x] **Agent-note promotion workflow** — `GET /proposals` review queue +
  `POST /promote` (`knowledge_proposals` / `knowledge_promote` in MCP): moves
  the note out of `agents/` on explicit human approval, stamps
  `promoted`/`promoted_from` provenance, flips extracted knowledge to
  `origin: human`, audit-logs the move (✅ 2026-06-12)
- [x] **Freshness surfacing** — `/search` results and `/impact` carry
  `updated_at` (last indexed) and `analysis_commit` (last platform-analysis
  reconciliation) so consumers weigh how current a hit is (✅ 2026-06-13).
  HEAD-staleness comparison stays in the private analysis-sync (needs GitHub)
- [ ] **Other MCP clients via remote** — additional clients (e.g. a separate
  Codex setup, kept on its own project) connect over the remote server, not
  the local stdio one — folded into the server-deployment track below. (A
  local `codex mcp add` was trialled and removed: that Codex instance serves a
  different project and must not share this memory.)
- [x] **Adoption metrics** — `usage_events` table + `onResponse` hook record
  every knowledge-facing request; `GET /stats` + `pnpm stats` show reads/writes,
  per-endpoint volume, and write-by-agent attribution, so we can see whether
  agents actually use the memory (one-time `--backfill` imports history from
  the API log) (✅ 2026-06-13)

### Long term
- [ ] **Server deployment & remote access** — move the stack (Postgres, Neo4j,
  API, indexer) to a server; vault synced via git/Obsidian Sync; MCP served
  over Streamable HTTP with auth, so any machine and any agent connects to the
  same memory remotely. Planned as a **private fork** of this repo (carries
  org-specific deployment/config); the remote MCP is what other clients
  (e.g. Codex) will connect to instead of the local stdio server.
- [ ] Contradiction monitoring (CONTRADICTS edges as a review queue)
- [ ] Temporal knowledge (SUPERSEDES chains as decision history timelines)
- [ ] Cross-vault federation (work + personal vaults, one query surface)
- [ ] Graph visualization beyond Neo4j Browser (Obsidian graph enrichment or web UI)
- [ ] Memory decay/archival policies for agent-generated notes
